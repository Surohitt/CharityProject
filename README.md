# Installation <a name='Installation'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python which can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/). The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3..

# Project Motivation <a name='Motivation'></a>

A big part of my project motivation was to outline how one would go about a typical machine learning classification challenge and data pipeline development. This project is tasked with finding potential donors for a charity.

1. How do we narrow which models to use for this classification task?
2. How can we tune our final models parameters to optimize performance ?
3. Which are the key relationships that help to predict if a person would donate?

The full data sets related to this project can be found on [the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). Also, I want to encourage pull requests and further analysis on top of this project!

# File Descriptions <a name="Descriptions"></a>


I have compiled all the analysis into one single notebook titled finding_donors.ipynb that answers all of the previously mentioned questions.

Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results <a name='Results'></a>

Stay tuned for a blog post discussing model evaluation metrics and tuning.

# Acknowledgements <a name='Acknowledgements'></a>

Thanks must go to UCI for creating this data set and allowing me to use it for this analysis.

Also, I would like to acknowledge Udacity for helping provide the skills and data science background that allowed me to complete this project. They inspired many of the questions that I went about answering and this project would not exist without their influence.
